# Demo material for presentations

## Install a Windows 10 Base Dev Box
This installs a base box with Git, Google Chrome, ConEmu and Visual Studio Code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacqinthebox/presentations.git
cd presentations
```
### with Virtualbox:
```
vagrant up --provider virtualbox 
```
### with Parallels
```
vagrant up --provider parallels
```

(Unfortunately I do not have an Hyper-V box yet)
